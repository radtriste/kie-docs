// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business processes, you can use {PRODUCT} business automation to develop process services using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 models. BPMN process models are graphical representations of the steps required to achieve a business goal. You can design your BPMN processes with the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer in VSCode or import existing BPMN processes into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution.

For more information about BPMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 specification].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT} is currently for Developer Preview only. Developer Preview releases contain features that might not be fully tested and are not in production-ready state. Customers are advised to avoid running the software for production or business-critical workloads. Customers are not able to open support cases against the Developer Preview releases. Red Hat does not commit to fixing any reported issues and the provided features might not be available in future releases.
