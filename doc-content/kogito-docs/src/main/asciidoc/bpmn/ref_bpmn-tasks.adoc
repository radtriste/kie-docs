= Tasks supported in {PRODUCT}

BPMN tasks identify actions that are completed in a business process model and are the smallest unit of work in a process flow.

{PRODUCT} currently supports the following tasks:

//@comment: Currently unavailable in VSCode. (Stetson, 26 Mar 2020)
In addition, the BPMN2 specification provides the ability to create custom tasks. The following predefined custom tasks are included with {PRODUCT}:

* Rest service tasks: Used to invoke a remote RESTful service
* Email service tasks: Used to send an email
* Log service tasks: Used to log a message
* Java service tasks: Used to call Java code
* WebService service tasks: Used to invoke a remote WebService call
* DecisionTask tasks: Used to execute a DMN diagram

.Business rule task
A business rule task specifies a business decision to be executed either through a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model or a Drools Rule Language (DRL) rule unit.

image::kogito/bpmn/bpmn-business-rule-task.png[]

When a process reaches a business rule task defined by a DMN model, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} executes the DMN model decision with the inputs provided.

When a process reaches a business rule task defined by a DRL rule unit, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} begins executing the rules in the designated rule unit group. When there are no more active rules in the rule unit, the execution continues to the next element. During the rule unit execution, new activations in the rule unit are added to the {DECISION_ENGINE} agenda because these activations are changed by other rules.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected business rule task:

.Business rule task properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Rule Language*
| Select *DMN* to invoke a defined DMN model or *DRL* to invoke a defined DRL rule unit.

| *Rule Flow Group* (DRL)
| Specify the new rule unit in the format `unit:__PACKAGE_NAME__.__UNIT_NAME__`, such as `unit:org.acme.kogito.PersonRules`. (This field name will be modified for clarity in a future release.)

| *Namespace*, *Decision Name*, *DMN Model Name* (DMN)
| Enter the identifying information for the relevant DMN model as found in the DMN model file.

| *On Entry Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

| *On Exit Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the end of the task.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Adhoc Autostart*
| Select this option if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. This option enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being starting by a start task.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Enter the date when the service level agreement (SLA) expires.

| *Assignments*
| Click to open the *Data I/O* window and add data inputs and outputs as required.
|===

.Script task
A script task represents a script to be executed during the process execution.

image::kogito/bpmn/bpmn-script-task.png[]

The associated script can access process variables and global variables. Review the following list of suggestions before using a script task:

* Avoid low-level implementation details in the process. A script task can be used to manipulate variables, but consider using a service task when modelling more complex operations.
* Ensure that the script is executed immediately, otherwise use an asynchronous service task.
* Avoid contacting external services through a script task. Use a service task to model communication with an external service.
* Ensure scripts do not throw exceptions. Runtime exceptions should be caught and managed inside the script or transformed into signals or errors that can then be handled inside the process.

When a script task is reached during execution, the script is executed and the outgoing flow is taken.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected script task:

.Script task properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Script*
| Enter a script in Java, JavaScript, or MVEL to be executed by the task, and select the script type.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Adhoc Autostart*
| Select this option if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. This option enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being starting by a start task.
|===

.User task
A user task is an activity in the process workflow that cannot be performed automatically by the system and therefore requires the intervention of a human user, the actor.

image::kogito/bpmn/bpmn-user-task.png[]

On execution, the user task element is instantiated as a task that appears in the list of tasks of one or more actors. If a user task element defines the `Groups` property, the task is displayed in task lists of all users that are members of the group. Any user who is a member of the group can claim the task. After a user task is claimed, the task disappears from the task list of the other users.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected user task:

|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*

| *Task Name*
| Enter the name of the task as it is displayed to human user (actor).

| *Subject*
| Enter a subject for the task.

| *Actors*
| Click *Add* to add a row and then select an actor from the list or click *New* to add a new actor. The actors are responsible for executing the human task.

| *Groups*

| *Reassignments*
| Click to specify a different actor to complete this task.

| *Notifications*
| Click to specify notifications associated with the task.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Description*
| Enter a description of the task as it is displayed to a human user (actor).

| *Multiple Instance*
| Select this option if this task has multiple instances.

| *On Entry Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

.Service task
A service task is an activity that is completed automatically by an external software service and does not require human interaction.

.None task
None tasks are completed on activation. This is a conceptual model only. A none task is never actually executed by an IT system.
